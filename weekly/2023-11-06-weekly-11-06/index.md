## Debugger

We are making progress on source debugging support. Currently, we support source mapping and setting breakpoints based on the source code. The next step will be to support inspecting local and global variables. Once this is completed, you can try it out and experience it firsthand. Stay tuned! ðŸ˜š

## Changes in MoonBit Language

Removed the `func` keyword, now only `fn` can be used to declare functions.
