# MoonBit Compiler Contributor Copyright Assignment Agreement V1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing software code to the project "MoonBit Compiler" ("moonc") hosted or managed by International Digital Economy Academy, or any of its affiliates ("IDEA").

To clarify the rights granted with Contributions(as defined below) from any person or entity, IDEA must have a Contributor Copyright Assignment Agreement ("CCAA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the terms below.

This CCAA allows a Contributor("You", as defined below) to submit Contributions to the applicable project, to authorize Contributions to IDEA, and to grant Copyright(as defined below) and patent licenses thereto. If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of this Agreement to jichuruanjian@idea.edu.cn only (do not copy any other persons or lists). For Individual, You may also choose to sign on https://moonbitlang.com/cla/moonc by clicking the corresponding button and authorizing Your GitHub account information. Read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to IDEA.

1. Definitions.

   "You" shall mean the individual who submits a Contribution to IDEA, or any legal entity (not a natural person) on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by IDEA. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to IDEA for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products or projects owned or managed by IDEA (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic or written communication sent to IDEA or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, IDEA for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

   "Copyright" shall mean all rights protecting works of authorship owned or controlled by You, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any extensions by You.

2. Assignment of Copyright.

   (a) Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You irrevocably hereby transfer to IDEA all rights, titles and interests in and to Your Contributions, and waive any rights, including moral rights, etc., that may affect IDEA’s ownership of the Copyright in the Contributions.

   (b) License to IDEA. If your assignment in Section 2(a) is ineffective for any reason, You grant to IDEA and to recipients of software distributed by IDEA a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable Copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

   (c) License to You. Upon such assignment of Copyright to IDEA, IDEA immediately grant to you a perpetual, worldwide, transferable, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute a Contribution and any derivative works you create based on a Contribution. This license is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the Work.

3. Grant of Patent License.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to IDEA and to recipients of software distributed by IDEA a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to assign the Copyright and grant the above license.

   (a) For Corporation, You represent further that each employee of the Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

   (b) For Individual, if your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to IDEA, or that your employer has executed a separate CCAA with IDEA.

5. You represent and warrant that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and You can legally grant the rights set out in this Agreement. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. You agree to notify IDEA immediately of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations and warranties inaccurate in any respect.

This CCAA was adapted from Apache Corporate Contributor License Agreement.
